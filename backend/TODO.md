## 📝 Notes

### Current Limitations
- Pilot program: 3 free AI requests/month (resets on 1st)
- Single founder per startup
- Premium features coming soon

### Environment Requirements
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless recommended)
- Redis (Upstash REST API)
- Minimum 2 LLM API keys for council

### Security Checklist
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ API key hashing (SHA-256)
- ✅ Timing-safe comparison
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Security headers (Helmet)
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Circuit breaker
- ✅ IP validation for proxy headers
- ✅ Error message sanitization
- ✅ Encryption key required in production
- ✅ SHA-256 cache keys (upgraded from MD5)
- ✅ Notion API timeout protection (30s)
- ✅ MCP tool discovery timeout (30s)
- ✅ Auth token caching (30s) to reduce Supabase calls
- ✅ Failed auth rate limiting (10 failed attempts/min per IP)
- ✅ SSE token via query param (EventSource limitation)

### Bug Fixes (v1.3.3)
- ✅ Auth rate limit rework - only count FAILED attempts, not all attempts
- ✅ Token caching to avoid re-verifying same token repeatedly
- ✅ SSE endpoints accept token via query parameter
- ✅ Frontend passes token via query param for SSE connections
- ✅ Users controller now has proper rate limiting
- ✅ Orchestrator DLQ retry count properly incremented on restore
- ✅ Campaigns N+1 query fixed (batch lead fetching in getEmails/sendCampaign)
- ✅ Secure documents chunkText infinite loop prevention
- ✅ MCP getToolSchema returns actual tool data from cache
